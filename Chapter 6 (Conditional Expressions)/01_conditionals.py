#Showing the use of 'if elif else' ladder in Python

#elif can be used multiple times

# z=200

# if(z>100):
#     print("z is greater than 100")
# elif(z>50):
#     print("z is greater than 50")
# elif(z>35):
#     print("z is greater than 35")
# elif(z>15):
#     print("z is greater than 15")
# else:
#     print("z is less than 15")

#We can also use multiple variables in conditional statement
x=2
y=-400
if x>0 and y>0:
    print("See")
else:
    print("Oops")


#using multiple if 

# x=20

# if(x>20):
#     print("x is greater than 20")
    
# if(x>18):
#     print("x is greater than 18")

# if (x>24):
#     print("x is greater than 24")
# else:
#     print("haha")
